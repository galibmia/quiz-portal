              <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>`map`, `filter`, and `forEach` are all array methods in JavaScript used for different purposes: <br>

                  <br> <b> 1. **forEach**:</b>
                       <br>- Syntax: `array.forEach(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                       <br>- Purpose: Executes a provided function once for each array element. It doesn't return a new array; it simply iterates over each element in the array and performs an action (usually a side effect).
                      <br> - Use Case: Use `forEach` when you want to perform an operation on each element of the array without changing the original array or creating a new one.
                    
                    <br><br><b>2. **map**:</b>
                      <br> - Syntax: `array.map(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                       <br>- Purpose: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
                       <br>- Use Case: Use `map` when you want to transform each element of an array into something else and return a new array with the transformed elements. It's particularly useful when you want to perform a one-to-one transformation.
                    
                   <br><br><b>3. **filter**:</b>
                       <br>- Syntax: `array.filter(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                      <br> - Purpose: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
                       <br>- Use Case: Use `filter` when you want to remove elements from an array based on a condition and return a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition. It's useful for filtering out unwanted elements from an array.
                    
                    <br><br><b>In summary:</b>
                   <br> - `forEach` is for executing a function on each element of an array without creating a new array.
                   <br> - `map` is for creating a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
                   <br> - `filter` is for creating a new array containing only the elements that pass a certain condition.
                    
                   <br><br>Each method serves a different purpose, so choose the one that best fits your specific use case.</p>

              <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What is the difference between local storage and session storage and cookies?</summary>
              <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>Cookies, local storage, and session storage are all integral parts of web browser storage mechanisms, each serving different purposes. Cookies, being small pieces of data, are primarily utilized for tracking user activity, maintaining user sessions, and storing preferences. They have expiration dates and are sent with every HTTP request, although they have a small storage limit. On the other hand, local storage provides a larger storage capacity compared to cookies and retains data even after the browser is closed and reopened. It's commonly used for storing application state, user preferences, and cached data. Session storage is similar to local storage but with a key distinction: the data stored in session storage is cleared when the browser session ends. This makes it suitable for storing temporary data that should only persist for the duration of a user's session. In essence, while cookies handle temporary data with expiration dates, local storage offers persistent storage across sessions, and session storage is ideal for temporary data within a browsing session.</p>

              <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What is Event Loop?</summary>
              <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>The Event Loop is a core concept in JavaScript that enables non-blocking asynchronous operations. It manages the execution of code by continuously checking the call stack and task queue. When the call stack is empty, it takes tasks from the queue and executes them, allowing JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.</p>

              <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What is JavaScript?</summary>
              <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for web development. JavaScript is commonly used to add interactivity, behavior, and dynamic content to websites. It runs on the client-side, meaning it executes in the user's web browser, enabling dynamic updates without requiring a page reload. Additionally, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side, thanks to environments like Node.js. It's known for its versatility, as it can be used for everything from simple scripting to complex web application development.</p>
