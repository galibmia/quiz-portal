              <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                <p>`map`, `filter`, and `forEach` are all array methods in JavaScript used for different purposes: <br>

                  <br> <b> 1. **forEach**:</b>
                       <br>- Syntax: `array.forEach(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                       <br>- Purpose: Executes a provided function once for each array element. It doesn't return a new array; it simply iterates over each element in the array and performs an action (usually a side effect).
                      <br> - Use Case: Use `forEach` when you want to perform an operation on each element of the array without changing the original array or creating a new one.
                    
                    <br><br><b>2. **map**:</b>
                      <br> - Syntax: `array.map(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                       <br>- Purpose: Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
                       <br>- Use Case: Use `map` when you want to transform each element of an array into something else and return a new array with the transformed elements. It's particularly useful when you want to perform a one-to-one transformation.
                    
                   <br><br><b>3. **filter**:</b>
                       <br>- Syntax: `array.filter(callbackFunction(element, index, array))`
                      <br> - Purpose: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
                       <br>- Use Case: Use `filter` when you want to remove elements from an array based on a condition and return a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition. It's useful for filtering out unwanted elements from an array.
                    
                    <br><br><b>In summary:</b>
                   <br> - `forEach` is for executing a function on each element of an array without creating a new array.
                   <br> - `map` is for creating a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
                   <br> - `filter` is for creating a new array containing only the elements that pass a certain condition.
                    
                   <br><br>Each method serves a different purpose, so choose the one that best fits your specific use case.</p>
